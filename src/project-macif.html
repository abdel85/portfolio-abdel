                  <p>This is a module that  I have realized as a part of my course in UX UI Design at Pop school that I’m currently  student</p>
                  <h2>About the app</h2>
                  <p>A mobile app that we worked created to improve the sales for Chrismas The challenge is to design a mobile app for Shiseido brand</p>
                  <h2>Goals</h2>
                  <p>The focus is to deliver a simple, easy, wonderful shopping experience for users
                      And to connect the physical sales point with the e-shop
                      Increase withdrawals at the shop or at point of sale  (POS)  to encourag environmentally friendly deliver 
                       (slow deliver)
                      personalization interface 
                    </p>



                    <h2>Projet progress</h2>
                    <p> As a team of four students we have designated 
                        a Decision-maker
                        a Facilitator
                        a Interviewer  (  to handle  interviews (looking for users to test, prepare questionnaire for interview ) and this was my role :)
                        others tasks ( user research, benchmark, sketches, prototype we have worked together )</p>

                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>We have worked Shiseido   is a brand Japanese   which offered a variety of cosmetic products of high quality, target mainly for adults women 
                            The brand has website already but to connect the physical sales point with the e-shop we have worked to develop a mobile app
                            That allows a good user experience and make known the brand more in the sale point like Sephora and Nocibé… </p>

<p> in this stage of our process we found that  MoSCow method  is very beneficial  
    it filters all the ideas that we have presented at the beginning and  prevents us from putting lot of time and exceed the deadline and might not result what we have expected

    then she buy the second product , and it’s about a gift for his sister that do not over than 100 euros </p>
